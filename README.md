# Card Deck tests

This exercise is to help you learn how to write and pass tests.

## Usage

To run the tests, run `rake` on the command line. `rake` is a Ruby program that
executes tasks from a file called a `Rakefile`. It is often used by Ruby
libraries to run tests and other tasks.

## What to do

Open `test/card_test.rb` and `lib/card.rb` in Atom. Go to the command line and
run `rake`. You will see text about your tests failing. Change the `Card` class
until your tests pass. Once your tests pass, uncomment the next test and make
it pass.

Repeat this for the `Deck` class and `test/deck_test.rb`.
